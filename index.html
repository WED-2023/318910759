  <h2>About Albert Einstein</h2>

        <div>
            <p>Albert Einstein was born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, Germany.</p>
            <p>Six weeks later, his family moved to Munich, where his father, Hermann Einstein, and uncle founded an electrical engineering company.</p>
            <p>From a young age, Albert displayed a profound curiosity and aptitude for mathematics and physics.</p>
            <p>Despite facing challenges in securing an academic position after graduating from the Swiss Federal Polytechnic School in Zurich, he eventually took a job at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern in 1902.</p>

        <h2>Annus Mirabilis - The Miracle Year:</h2>
        <div>
            <p>In 1905, often referred to as his "miracle year," Einstein published four groundbreaking papers that would transform the landscape of physics:</p>
            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>"Photoelectric Effect: He introduced the concept that light consists of particles, or quanta, explaining how and why electrons are emitted from materials when exposed to light. This work earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921."</li>
                    <p></p>
                    <li>"Brownian Motion: He provided a theoretical explanation for the random movement of particles suspended in a fluid, offering strong evidence for the existence of atoms."</li>
                    <p></p>
                    <li>"Special Theory of Relativity: Einstein proposed that the laws of physics are the same for all non-accelerating observers, introducing the idea that time and space are relative and linked in a four-dimensional continuum known as spacetime."</li>
                    <p></p>
                    <li>"Mass-Energy Equivalence: From his relativity theory, he derived the famous equation E=mc², indicating that mass and energy are interchangeable."</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
        </div>
        <br>

        <h2>Academic Career and Later Life:</h2>
        <div>
            <p>Einstein's revolutionary ideas gained him recognition, leading to academic positions in Zurich, Prague, and Berlin.</p>
            <p>In 1915, he introduced the General Theory of Relativity, extending his earlier work to include gravity as a property of the curvature of spacetime.</p>
            <p>This theory was confirmed in 1919 during a solar eclipse when starlight was observed bending around the sun, aligning with Einstein's predictions.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>With the rise of the Nazi regime in Germany, Einstein emigrated to the United States in 1933, joining the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey.</p>
            <p>He became an American citizen in 1940 and was known for his advocacy of civil rights, Zionism, and pacifism. Einstein passed away on April 18, 1955, in Princeton.</p>
        </div>
        <br>

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <div>
            <p>Albert Einstein had a deep passion for music.</p>
            <p>He began playing the violin at the age of five and continued playing throughout his life.</p>
            <p>He once said, "Life without playing music is inconceivable for me." Einstein particularly enjoyed classical composers like Mozart and Bach. Music helped him relax and often sparked his creativity.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Another one of his favorite hobbies was sailing.</p>
            <p>Although he wasn't a very skilled sailor and even admitted he couldn't swim, he enjoyed the quiet and peaceful atmosphere on the water. He often sailed alone, using the time to think deeply.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>In addition to music and sailing, Einstein also enjoyed walking, reading philosophy, and daydreaming, all of which gave him space for reflection and imagination.</p>
        </div>
        <br>
        
        <h2>In Popular Culture</h2>
        <div>
            <p>Albert Einstein became more than a scientific icon - he became a symbol of <b>intelligence and creativity</b> around the world.</p>
            <p>His image, especially the famous photo of him sticking out his tongue, is widely recognized and often used in posters, memes, and pop art.</p>
            <p>The name “Einstein” has become a common way to refer to someone highly intelligent.</p>
            <p>He has been referenced in countless movies, TV shows, cartoons, books, and even video games.</p>
            <p>Einstein has appeared or been mentioned in shows like The Big Bang Theory, Doctor Who, and Genius.</p>
            <p>His character and likeness are used to inspire curiosity and represent scientific thinking in popular media.</p>
